# PyFVS

PyFVS is a fork of the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/open-fvs/">Open-FVS</a> project. It's primary goal is to provide a Pythonic API to make automating FVS projections a breeze. It also provides a number of enhancements that improve the performance and utility of the Open-FVS library functions.
